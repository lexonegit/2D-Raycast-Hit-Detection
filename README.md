# 2D Raycast Hit Detection

2D Raycast Hit Detection is a tool for detecting if a moving object hit something using raycasting. It is useful for when you need more precise detection quality or the object is moving very fast (a bullet for example)

**Note that this is not a 100% user friendly script. You most likely need to modify the script to suit your needs. Also with a bit of tinkering this should be easy to convert for 3D games as well**

## Usage
1. Add **Sensors.cs** to a gameObject
2. Assign the 3 transforms in the inspector
3. Tweak the options to see what works the best

**I recommend looking at the included ExampleProject for a better understanding**
